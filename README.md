# KaseiCoin Crowdsale  Token Crowdsale

## Overview

This a smart contract for  a fungible token that is ERC-20 compliant and that will be minted by using a `Crowdsale` contract from the OpenZeppelin Solidity library.

The `Crowdsale` contract createD has capability to manage the entire crowdsale process, allowing users to send ether to the contract and in return receive KSC, or KaseiCoin tokens. The  contract mints the tokens automatically and distribute them to buyers in one transaction.

### Approach and Methodology

1. Created the KaseiCoin Token Contract

2. Created the KaseiCoin Crowdsale Contract

3. Created the KaseiCoin Deployer Contract

4. Deployed the Crowdsale to a Local Blockchain


#### Results 

 After deploying  the crowdsale to a local blockchain with Remix, MetaMask 

1. The following are the results from testing  the functionality of the crowdsale by using test accounts to buy new tokens and then checking the balances associated with those accounts.


2. And after purchasing tokens with one or more test accounts, the amount of wei that has been raised in the crowdsale contract.
